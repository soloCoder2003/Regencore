NextCell
NextCell is a lightweight demo platform designed to identify second-life applications for used EV batteries. It serves as a matchmaking tool to connect EV battery owners with sustainable reuse opportunities based on battery health and geographic location.

🌱 Sustainable Engineering Domain: Waste Management & Eco Awareness
As part of a sustainable engineering initiative, NextCell addresses two critical areas:

Waste Management

Eco Awareness

With the rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, millions of lithium-ion batteries are being retired despite having 60–80% of their usable capacity left. These partially viable batteries often end up in landfills, contributing to electronic waste and environmental hazards. NextCell intervenes at this point of disposal, offering a second life to such batteries and diverting them from the waste stream.

🔄 Relevance to Waste Management
Reduces E-Waste: By facilitating reuse, NextCell helps lower the volume of high-impact electronic waste entering the environment.

Resource Optimization: Extracting maximum utility from a battery before recycling conserves raw materials and reduces demand for new manufacturing.

Decentralized Waste Handling: By enabling regional matches for reuse, transportation overheads and carbon footprints are reduced.

🌍 Relevance to Eco Awareness
Promotes Conscious Consumption: Users become more aware of the latent potential in their used batteries rather than disposing of them thoughtlessly.

Community Involvement: The platform encourages local reuse — such as in solar backup systems or microgrid storage — increasing eco-responsibility at the grassroots level.

Educational Impact: It provides a practical example of circular economy principles, inspiring further innovation in sustainable product lifecycle management.

🔧 Problem Statement
As EV usage increases, the challenge of managing retired lithium-ion batteries grows. Despite retaining substantial capacity, most are discarded without consideration for reuse. There are limited tools for individuals or small businesses to assess and repurpose these batteries efficiently.

🛠 Solution
NextCell is a user-friendly, web-based platform that:

Allows EV battery owners to input battery details (capacity, model, location).

Matches them with relevant second-life applications (e.g., solar energy storage, telecom backups, microgrids).

Connects them with verified local users or institutions interested in acquiring such batteries.
